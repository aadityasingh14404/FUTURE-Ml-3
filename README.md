Built a customer support chatbot using NLP techniques and AI-based conversation design tools to deliver intelligent and context-aware interactions. 🤖✨

This project allowed me to dive deep into natural language processing, chatbot development, and user engagement strategies to build an AI assistant capable of handling real customer queries.

✨ Key Highlights:

🎯 NLP-Powered Chatbot: Implemented chatbot capabilities using Python libraries like TensorFlow and NLTK to understand and respond to customer inquiries.

🧑‍💻 Memory & Context Awareness: Integrated ChromaDB to enable meaningful, long-term conversation memory and context management.

📊 Voice Interaction: Enabled real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech communication using DeepSpeech for a more natural user experience.

💡 Adaptive Personality: Designed dynamic behavior adjustments, allowing the chatbot to switch tones between casual and professional based on the interaction.

🖥️ Web Integration: Deployed the chatbot on a simple, intuitive web interface built with Streamlit for easy access and live interaction tracking.

Excited to continue innovating in conversational AI and push the boundaries of intelligent customer engagement! 🚀
